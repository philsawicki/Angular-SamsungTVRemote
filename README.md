# Angular SmartTV Remote

Control your TV from any web-enabled device in your household. Android phone, Apple tablet or LG fridge.

All you need is a platform to host the Application in the background. It can be anything from a desktop, laptop or even a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)!

The Application packages a Node server running Express which looks for UPnP-connected TVs on the network, and serves an Angular web application as a remote. Browse the list of available TVs, associate with them, then sit down and enjoy!

You can even expose the remote application to the Internet, and access it from anywhere â€“ or use the API to create your own interface with the TV.
